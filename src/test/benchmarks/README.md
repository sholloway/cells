# Benchmarks

---

This folder contains benchmark tests that leverage Benchmark.js
to compare alternative methods to common operations.

## Running Benchmarks

The benchmarks are designed to be ran one at a time. They are
standalone Node.js applications.

```shell
node src/test/benchmarks/build_quadtrees.js
