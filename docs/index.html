Originally, I thought it would be a fun challenge to build John Conway’s <i>Game of Life</i>. That then expanded into exploring Stephen Wolfram’s 256 rules. For an introduction to both of these topics, see Daniel Shiffman's book <a href="https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/">The Nature of Code</a>.</p><p>After completing my version of the game of life I added support for <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Generations">generational</a> rule sets. These multi-state simulations can create rich patterns by controlling color based on how many iterations a cell has survived.</p><h2>My Little Program</h2><p>The program allows you to run different types of cellular automata rules. Think of rules as a population simulation. Each position on the grid can contain an alive cell or nothing. Before running a simulation you can set the initial population by clicking on the grid.</p><p>Right clicking on the grid displays the context menu. The context menu provides a set of templates for building up a population. The bottom group of templates are some of Stephen Wolfram's 256 rules. Be default, Wolfram's rules all start with a single alive cell at the middle of the first row. To randomize a rule's starting inputs check the <i>Random Start</i> checkbox.</p><h3>Disclaimer</h3><p>This is a hobby project and as such has not been thoroughly tested on all browsers.
